Text Analyzer

A responsive web application for real-time text analysis that provides comprehensive insights into text content. This project demonstrates modern frontend development practices with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and clean code architecture.

Project Overview

Text Analyzer helps writers, students, and professionals understand their writing patterns through instant statistical analysis. As users type or paste text, the application calculates various metrics in real-time, providing valuable feedback for content creation and editing.

Features

· Real-time Text Analysis: Instant calculation of characters, words, and sentences as you type
· Flexible Character Counting: Toggle between including or excluding spaces in character counts
· Customizable Limits: Set and modify character limits with visual warnings when exceeded
· Reading Time Estimation: Calculate approximate reading time based on average reading speed
· Letter Density Visualization: Display frequency distribution of letters in the analyzed text
· Theme System: Seamless switching between light and dark modes with persistent user preference
· Keyboard Accessibility: Full keyboard navigation support with visual focus indicators
· Responsive Design: Optimized layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

Technical Implementation

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases:

· Modern CSS: Custom properties for theming, CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts, and responsive design principles
· Clean JavaScript: Modular code structure, efficient event handling, and real-time text processing algorithms
· Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, and semantic HTML
· Performance: Client-side processing ensures fast analysis without server dependencies

Technologies Used

· HTML5
· CSS3 (Custom Properties, Grid, Flexbox)
· Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
· Font Awesome Icons

Key Challenges & Solutions

· Real-time Processing: Implemented efficient text analysis algorithms that handle large inputs without performance issues
· Theme System: Developed a CSS custom properties-based theming system with smooth transitions
· Character Limit Management: Created intuitive limit editing with proper validation and user feedback
· Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensured consistent experience across modern browsers with progressive enhancement

Project Structure

The application follows a clean separation of concerns with dedicated files for structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and functionality (JavaScript). The code is organized for maintainability and easy extension.
